\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap_intro}

The world of cellular mobile communications has changed substantially since its beginnings in the late 20th century.
New generations of mobile networks have been developed on a ten-year basis. The key drivers for wireless networks development were enabling widespread connectivity, faster data rates, improved access to media and the objective of a fully-connected society.

The first generation (1G) networks in the 1980s introduced basic voice calls, subsequently the second generation (2G) networks brought us text messaging capabilities. The arrival of third generation (3G) networks enabled faster internet access and the ability to browse the web on our mobile devices. 
Fourth generation (4G) networks aimed at providing faster data speeds and allowing for video streaming and online gaming on our smartphones. 
Currently, we can see the fifth generation (5G) introduction, which promises ultra-fast speeds, low latency, and the potential to support future technologies such as autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things (IoT). 

Mobile cellular networks beyond fifth and sixth-generation wireless systems (5G-Advanced and 6G) are set to provide connectivity not only to end-users with improved capabilities, but also to different types of devices such as buildings, vehicles, and appliances.
The main focus of 5G is on connecting devices from the Internet of Things (IoT) and helping to automate industrial systems, 6G aims at unifying the human experience across the physical, digital, and human world creating connected intelligence \cite{6G-explained-NOKIA}.

6G will build on top of 5G and 5G-Advanced systems, driving their adoption through optimization and cost reduction. 
One of the most notable advancements in 6G technology will be the ability to perceive the surrounding environment, including people and objects, called network sensing. This capability converts the network into a source of valuable situational data by capturing and interpreting signals reflected by various entities. 
Determining characteristics such as type, shape, relative position, speed, and even material properties, advanced sensing empowers the creation of true-to-model digital twins.
Moreover, when this data is fused with information from other sensors, artificial intelligence and machine learning, it unlocks new insights from the physical world, enhancing the network's cognitive abilities.
