\chapter{Outlook and Conclusion}

In summary, this thesis investigated the integration of sensing and communication capabilities in the context of 5G Advanced and 6G wireless systems. 
The main objective of this work was to explore the potential of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing techniques and their applications in integrated radar systems at mmWave. 

The results obtained from processing real-word measurements suggest that use cases with NLOS conditions should be considered in future studies in ISAC.
With a focus on intrusion detection this work suggests that, with further analysis of the NLOS radar returns and the corresponding processing techniques, NLOS sensing at mmWave is possible.

The main contributions of this work can be summarized as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-word NLOS sensing trials and identification of challenges due to communication requirements.
	\item Proposal of CSI processing approaches for avoiding unwanted replicas in the periodogram.
	\item Definition of requirements for NLOS sensing and validation on measurements from the prototype.
\end{itemize}
