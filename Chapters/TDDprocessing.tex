\label{chap:TDD pattern of the OFDM frame}

The following Chapter outlines the methods and proposed processing steps applied to the \gls{csi} to perform \gls{isac} in \gls{nlos} using Nokia's \gls{poc}.
Section \ref{sec:frame_sampling_strategies} discusses the limitations in sensing performance caused by empty \gls{ul} symbols in the received OFDM frame and proposes some approaches to mitigate this effect.
These approaches can be used to perform \gls{isac} in general and are not specific for \gls{nlos} scenarios.
Section \ref{sec:radar_search_detection} deals with the target detection task applied to the periodogram, focusing on possible thresholding methods suitable for the \gls{nlos} scenario.
Clutter removal is discussed in Section \ref{sec:clutter_removal}, where two existing algorithms used in the \gls{poc} are described.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:nlos_proc_pipeline} describes the processing steps dedicated to \gls{nlos} sensing, considering an intrusion detection use case.

\section{Effect of TDD transmission on sensing performance}
\label{sec:frame_sampling_strategies}
	Initially in Nokia's \gls{poc}, processing of the \gls{csi} for sensing was performed separately for each \gls{ofdm} frame: every $10$ ms the system would output a received \gls{ofdm} frame, compute the periodogram of the corresponding \gls{csi} and generate a target state update. When the entire frame is processed, the number of subcarriers and symbols is quite large, resulting in good radar performance and significant \gls{snr} gain after computing the periodogram, as per Equation \eqref{eq:periodogram_processing_gain}. However, this approach suffers from the presence of unwanted spectral replicas caused by the \gls{ul} symbols in the frame.
	Received \gls{ul} symbols are transmitted from the \glspl{ue} towards the \gls{gnb} and are not generated by reflection of the \gls{dl} signal on objects in the environment.
	For this reason, they do not contain any useful information for radar processing, hence they are discarded (set to zero) before computing the periodogram.
	As shown in Section \ref{sec:intro-PoCarchitecture}, the gNB transmits in a TDD pattern. Each pattern consists of 104 \gls{dl} symbols followed by 36 \gls{ul} symbols, repeated 8 times in each frame. A sample \gls{csi} frame highlighting such patterns is shown in Figure \ref{fig:CSIMatrix_DLULpattern}.
    The removal of \gls{ul} symbols can be viewed as time-windowing on the received frame, where \gls{ul} symbols are multiplied by zero and \gls{dl} symbols by ones.

    \end{figure}
    The windowing function applied to the \gls{csi} of a single frame and its Fourier transform are shown in Figure \ref{fig:TDDwindowingfunct}.
    The time-domain window applied to each subcarrier of the OFDM frame can be expressed in the form
    \begin{align}
        w_{\text{TDD}}(k) &= \text{rect}\left( \frac{k + \tau}{104 \cdot T_S}\right) \ast \sum_{i=0}^7 \delta\left( k - i\cdot \frac{140}{1120} \right).
    \end{align}
    The windowing function, apart from a time-shift factor, is a rectangle function (Dirichlet window) convoluted with a train of Dirac deltas with spacing of 140 samples, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:TDDproc_rectfunct}. Its Fourier transform, in Figure \ref{fig:TDDproc_rectfunct_transform}, is a cardinal sine (Dirichlet's kernel) function multiplied by a train of Dirac deltas.
    The transform is then convoluted with the signal in the frequency domain. 
    Spectral holes in time introduce additional spectral replicas in speed, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:SpectralReplicasDLULpattern}. Replicas seem to appear at a constant speed displacement from where actual targets lie, behaving similarly to replicas introduced by the radar's non-ambiguity in speed.
    The impulses adjacent to the one at zero-frequency appear as replicas in the periodogram. These peaks have sufficient power to be detected as real targets, thus limiting the performance of the system by reducing the effective unambiguous velocity. Even though their power is significantly lower compared to the main lobe, they can cause masking of real targets that would be detected near the replica, especially in \gls{nlos} where the return power is low.

	\subsection{PoC's fundamental performance limits}
		
		System performance can be evaluated in terms of resolution and unambiguous aperture, for both range and speed.
		Unambiguous range $d_{\text{unamb}}$ and speed $v_{\text{unamb}}$ are the maximum values that can be measured for a target without any ambiguity or ambiguity-related errors, and depend on the sampling rate in the respective domain, defined by subcarrier spacing and \gls{ofdm} symbol time.
		Range and speed resolution, $d_{\text{res}}$ and $v_{\text{res}}$, refer to the system's ability to resolve targets in terms of their range and speed and depend on the aperture in frequency and time domain, given by the overall bandwidth $\Delta f N$ and the frame duration $T_S M$, respectively. 
	
		When generating the periodogram by processing the \gls{csi} of a single frame, with the parameters indicated in Table \ref{table:PoCparams},
		the \gls{poc} operates with the following performance:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Unambiguous speed}
			\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Remove extra whitespace
			\begin{equation}
				v_{\text{unamb}} = \frac{c_0}{2f_C T_S} = 613.5\text{ m/s}.
			\end{equation}
			
			\item \textbf{Unambiguous range}
			\begin{equation}
				d_{\text{unamb}} = \frac{c_0}{2\Delta f} = 1250.0\text{ m}.
			\end{equation}
			\item \textbf{Speed resolution}
			\begin{equation}
				v_{\text{res}} = \frac{c_0}{2T_Sf_CM} = 0.547 \text{ m/s}.
			\end{equation} 
			\item \textbf{Range resolution}
			\begin{equation}
				d_{\text{res}} = \frac{c_0}{2\Delta fN} = 0.789 \text{ m}.
			\end{equation}  
		\end{itemize}
			This performance, especially the unambiguous speed, is more than sufficient for most indoor use cases. 
			This offers the possibility of applying different pre-processing strategies to the OFDM frame to avoid the presence of replicas in exchange for some of the system performance. 
			
			In order to avoid the presence of the spectral replicas, an additional processing step before computing the periodogram is introduced.
			The \gls{csi} matrix can be resampled in a way that allows to avoid processing any empty \gls{ul} symbol.
			This processing step will act in the time-dimension of the \gls{csi}, resulting in a change in the system's performance in speed.
			The next Section analyses a number of possible strategies, their impact on system performance and their tradeoffs.    

	\subsection{Time-domain resampling of the CSI}

		    \begin{figure}[H]
		        \centering
		        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/TDDprocessing/TDDstrategies.eps}
		        \caption{\small Decimation and combination of different consecutive frames. Red highlighted symbols are resampled at constant pace, avoiding blank \gls{ul} symbols (white slots).}
		        \label{fig:TDDstrategies}
		    \end{figure}
		
		    \paragraph{Single DL pattern:}
		    to avoid processing empty \gls{ul} symbols, the simplest approach would be to process only the first 104 \gls{dl} symbols. The replicas would be avoided, but the time aperture of the measurement would be reduced more than eight times, worsening the speed resolution from $0.603$ m/s to approximately $5.88$ m/s, which is unusable for most indoor sensing use cases.
		    
		    \paragraph{Decimation at constant interval:}
		     a possible strategy is decimating the OFDM frame in time at a fixed pace, while avoiding blank \gls{ul} symbols. 
		     By discarding symbols, performance in unambiguous speed is reduced. However, by selecting symbols with a constant stride and avoiding \gls{ul} blanks, the windowing effect experienced by the standard frame is removed.
		     The minimum stride allowed for the single frame is one symbol every 47, which will select 3 symbols out of every \gls{dl} section.
		     
		     The overall amount of symbols in a processed \gls{csi} is reduced from 1120 to 24.
		     Replicas are not detected, but the lower number of processed elements results into a considerable loss of \gls{snr} in the periodogram. In the obtained measurements a loss of ca. 15 dB was detected, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:TDDperiodogram1FYesDec}, similar to the expected loss of $10\log_{10}(1/47) \approx 16$~dB, as per Equation \ref{eq:periodogram_processing_gain}.
		     The \gls{snr} values measured for the different approaches are presented in Table \ref{table:TDDstratcomparison}. 
		     This loss affects \gls{nlos} sensing in particular, since targets observed from a reflection present a considerably lower peak power compared with the \gls{los} components.
		     The decimation of the \gls{csi} matrix results in a decrease in unambiguous speed. In the case of Figure \ref{fig:TDDperiodogram1FYesDec}, processing one symbol every 47, the obtained unambiguous speed is $13.05$ m/s. Time aperture of the acquisition and, consequently, speed resolution remain unchanged.
		    
		     \paragraph{Decimation and multi-frame processing:}
		     by combining consecutive frames, it is possible to process a higher number of symbols, regaining a part of the \gls{snr} thanks to processing gain, all without observing replicas. 
		     Time aperture of the measurement is also increased, resulting in better speed resolution.
		     
			 In order to combine several consecutive CSI measurements, the decimation rate is further reduced compared to the previous approach to one sample every 70. 
			 Two symbols are chosen from each DL pattern, and UL symbols can be avoided across multiple consecutive frames.
			 The number of time samples obtained from a single CSI is reduced from 1120 to 16.
			 Unambiguous speed is further reduced to $8.76$ m/s.
			 
			 Multiple frames must be received before generating a radar update.
			 This approach introduces a trade-off between \gls{snr} (processing gain) and update rate, with the update rate being reduced proportionally to number of processed frames.
		     For use cases such as intrusion detection, an update every 10 ms may not strictly necessary, and the higher detection probability due to the higher \gls{snr} can be considered acceptable.
		     To increase the number of updates, the observation time-window stride can be configured to be lower than its length, allowing time windows of successive acquisition to overlap.
		      
		     Increasing the time aperture has two effects: speed resolution of the system is improved and target migration effects can be observed (especially for fast-moving targets). 
		     Range and speed migration occur when the target moves and changes velocity during the observation windows, resulting in a return "spread" in the obtained periodogram.
		     In the context of NLOS sensing, the impact of range migration on system performance is relatively low compared to the benefits of increased speed resolution and higher \gls{snr}, as the primary objective is not to provide precise tracking or positioning data.
			Figures \ref{fig:TDDperiodogram1FNoDec}-\ref{fig:TDDperiodogram10frames} show the effects of the various strategies when applied to a OFDM radar measurement where both the \gls{nlos} and \gls{los} components are present for a single target.

	\subsection{Doppler artefacts observed for multiple frame processing}

		When processing several consecutive frames, Doppler artefacts can be observed in the corresponding periodograms.
		They appear as vertical lines of high power compared to the underlying noise floor.
		For \gls{los} scenarios the artefacts do not limit the performance of the system, while in \gls{nlos} their power is similar to the one of target returns.
		Figure \ref{fig:TDD_artefacts} shows that the power of the artefacts increases with the time aperture of the processed frame.
		The exact cause of these artefacts was not identified and their removal is out of the scope of this work. It is known that the 5G system used in the prototype from Nokia requires synchronization of component clock sources.
		It is likely that these artefacts are caused by phase compensations applied to the \gls{ofdm} signal both on a per-frame basis and within a single frame.
