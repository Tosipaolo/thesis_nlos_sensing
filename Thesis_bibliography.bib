In C-RAN research, a variety of different functional splits is presented by different names and focusing on different directions. The functional split determines how many base station functions to leave locally, close to the user, with the benefit of relaxing fronthaul network bitrate and delay requirements, and how many functions to centralize with the possibility of achieving greater processing benefits. This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive overview systematizing the different work directions for both research and industry, while providing a detailed description of each functional split option and an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages. This paper gives an overview of where the most effort has been directed in terms of functional splits, and where there is room for further studies. The standardization currently taking place is also considered and mapped into the research directions. It is investigated how the fronthaul network will be affected by the choice of functional split, both in terms of bitrates and latency, and as the different functional splits provide different advantages and disadvantages, the option of flexible functional splits is also looked into.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Communications Surveys \& Tutorials}, author={Larsen, Line M.

@inproceedings{Henninger_CRAP_2023, title={CRAP: Clutter Removal with Acquisitions Under Phase Noise}, url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10317664}, DOI={10.1109/6GNet58894.2023.10317664}, abstractNote={The emergence of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in future 6G networks comes with a variety of challenges to be solved. One of those is clutter removal, which should be applied to remove the influence of unwanted components, scattered by the environment, in the acquired sensing signal. While legacy radar systems already implement different clutter removal algorithms, ISAC requires techniques that are tailored to the envisioned use cases and the specific challenges that communications deployments bring along, like phase noise due to clock errors between transmitter and receiver. To that end, in this work we introduce Clutter Removal with Acquisitions Under Phase Noise (CRAP). We propose to vectorize the time-frequency channel acquired in a radio frame in a high-dimensional space. In an offline clutter acquisition step, singular value decomposition is used to determine the major clutter components. At runtime, the clutter is then estimated and removed by a subspace projection of the acquired radio frame onto the clutter components. Simulation results prove that CRAP offers benefits over prior art techniques robust to phase noise. In particular, our proposal does not suppress zero Doppler information, thereby enabling the detection of slow targets. Moreover, we show CRAP’s real-time applicability in a millimeter-wave ISAC proof of concept, where a pedestrian is tracked in a cluttered lab environment.}, booktitle={2023 2nd International Conference on 6G Networking (6GNet)}, author={Henninger, Marcus and Mandelli, Silvio and Grudnitsky, Artjom and Wild, Thorsten and ten Brink, Stephan}, year={2023}, month={October}, pages={1-8} }
