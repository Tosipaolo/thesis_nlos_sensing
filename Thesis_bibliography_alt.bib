However, poor propagation conditions such as non-line of sight (NLOS) and rich multipath still pose many challenges due to outlier measurements that significantly degrade the positioning performance.In this work, we introduce an iterative positioning method that reweights the time of arrival (ToA) and angle of arrival (AoA) measurements originating from multiple locators in order to efficiently remove outliers. In contrast to existing approaches that typically rely on a single locator to set the time reference for the time difference of arrival (TDoA) measurements corresponding to the remaining locators, and whose measurements may be unreliable, the proposed iterative approach does not rely on a reference locator only. The resulting robust position estimate is then used to initialize a computationally efficient gradient search to perform maximum likelihood position estimation.Our proposal is validated with an experimental setup at 3.75 GHz with 5G numerology in an indoor factory scenario, achieving an error of less than 50 cm in 95% of the measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this paper describes the first proof of concept for 5G-based joint ToA and AoA localization.}, booktitle={2022 Joint European Conference on Networks and Communications & 6G Summit (EuCNC/6G Summit)}, author={Henninger, Marcus and Abrudan, Traian E. and Mandelli, Silvio and Arnold, Maximilian and Saur, Stephan and Kolmonen, Veli-Matti and Klein, Siegfried and Schlitter, Thomas and Brink, Stephan Ten}, year={2022}, month=jun, pages={249–254} }

One of those is clutter removal, which should be applied to remove the influence of unwanted components, scattered by the environment, in the acquired sensing signal. While legacy radar systems already implement different clutter removal algorithms, ISAC requires techniques that are tailored to the envisioned use cases and the specific challenges that communications deployments bring along, like phase noise due to clock errors between transmitter and receiver. To that end, in this work we introduce Clutter Removal with Acquisitions Under Phase Noise (CRAP). We propose to vectorize the time-frequency channel acquired in a radio frame in a high-dimensional space. In an offline clutter acquisition step, singular value decomposition is used to determine the major clutter components. At runtime, the clutter is then estimated and removed by a subspace projection of the acquired radio frame onto the clutter components. Simulation results prove that CRAP offers benefits over prior art techniques robust to phase noise. In particular, our proposal does not suppress zero Doppler information, thereby enabling the detection of slow targets. Moreover, we show CRAP’s real-time applicability in a millimeter-wave ISAC proof of concept, where a pedestrian is tracked in a cluttered lab environment.}, booktitle={2023 2nd International Conference on 6G Networking (6GNet)}, author={Henninger, Marcus and Mandelli, Silvio and Grudnitsky, Artjom and Wild, Thorsten and ten Brink, Stephan}, year={2023}, month=oct, pages={1–8} }

In C-RAN research, a variety of different functional splits is presented by different names and focusing on different directions.

This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive overview systematizing the different work directions for both research and industry, while providing a detailed description of each functional split option and an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages. This paper gives an overview of where the most effort has been directed in terms of functional splits, and where there is room for further studies. The standardization currently taking place is also considered and mapped into the research directions. It is investigated how the fronthaul network will be affected by the choice of functional split, both in terms of bitrates and latency, and as the different functional splits provide different advantages and disadvantages, the option of flexible functional splits is also looked into.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials}, author={Larsen, Line M.

This survey paper takes a needed step towards ISAC deployment, providing an analytical toolkit to model cellular systems’ sensing performance, accounting for both their fundamental and practical constraints. We then elaborate on the likely features of 6G systems to provide the feasible sensing key performance indicators (KPIs) in the frequency ranges spanned by cellular networks, including the potential new bands available in 6G, the Frequency Range 3 (FR3). We further validate our framework by visually investigating ISAC constraints with simulation examples.

In this paper, approaches to the design of intelligent waveforms, that are suitable for simultaneously performing both data transmission and radar sensing, are proposed. The approach is based on classical phase-coded waveforms utilized in wireless communications. In particular, requirements that allow for employing such signals for radar measurements with high dynamic range are investigated. Also, a variety of possible radar processing algorithms are discussed. Moreover, the applicability of multiple antenna techniques for direction-of-arrival estimation is considered.

In many scenarios besides static targets there are numerous moving objects with very different characteristics, such as extent, movement behavior or micro-Doppler spread. It would be most desirable to have algorithms that extract all information on static and moving object automatically, without a system operator. In this paper, we present measurements conducted with a commercially available high-resolution multi-channel linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar and algorithms that do not only produce radar images but a description of the scenario on a higher level. After conventional spectrum estimation and thresholding, we present a clustering stage that combines individual detections and generates representations of each target individually. This stage is followed by a Kalman filter based multi-target tracking block. The tracker allows us to follow each target and collect its properties over time. With this method of jointly estimating tracks and characteristics of each individual target in a scenario, inputs for classifiers can be generated. Which, in turn, will be able to generate information that could be used for driver assistance or alarm trigger systems.}, journal={IEEE Access}, author={Wagner, Thomas and Feger, Reinhard and Stelzer, Andreas}, year={2017}, pages={1220–1238} }

Radio sensing using the mobile communication network as a sensor has the potential to become an essential component of the solution. With the evolution of cellular systems to mmWave bands in 5G and potentially sub-THz bands in 6G, small cell deployments will begin to dominate. Large bandwidth systems deployed in small cell configurations provide an unprecedented opportunity to employ the mobile network for sensing. In this paper, we focus on the major design aspects of such a cellular joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system. We present an analysis of the choice of the waveform that points towards choosing the one that is best suited for communication also for radar sensing. We discuss several techniques for efficiently integrating the sensing capability into the JCAS system, some of which are applicable with NR air-interface for evolved 5G systems. Specifically, methods for reducing sensing overhead by appropriate sensing signal design or by configuring separate numerologies for communications and sensing are presented. Sophisticated use of the sensing signals is shown to reduce the signaling overhead by a factor of 2.67 for an exemplary road traffic monitoring use case.

In PMNs, JCAS integrates sensing into communications, sharing a majority of system modules and the same transmitted signals. The PMN is expected to provide a ubiquitous radio sensing platform and enable a vast number of novel smart applications, whilst providing non-compromised communications. In this paper, we present a broad picture of the motivation, methodologies, challenges, and research opportunities of realizing PMN, by providing a comprehensive survey for systems and technologies developed mainly in the last ten years. Beginning by reviewing the work on coexisting communication and radar systems, we highlight their limits on addressing the interference problem, and then introduce the JCAS technology. We then set up JCAS in the mobile network context and envisage its potential applications. We continue to provide a brief review of three types of JCAS systems, with particular attention to their differences in design philosophy.
